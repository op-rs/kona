# Docker Guide

:::info

This guide uses Kona's pre-packaged docker config.

For detailed usage of the `kona-node` binary, head
over to [the binary guide](/node/run/binary).

:::

Kona provides a [`kona-node` docker recipe][recipe]
with detailed instructions.


### Docker Compose

In the [provided docker compose][compose], there are a few services
aside from the `kona-node` and `op-reth`. These are `prometheus`
and `grafana` which automatically come provisioned with dashboards
for monitoring and insight into the `kona-node` and `op-reth` services.
For more detail into how Prometheus and Grafana work, head over to the
[Monitoring][monitoring] docs.

Now, in the `docker-compose`, both `op-reth` and `kona-node` use images
published to the github container registry. The images defined here can
be overridden to use a local image or a specific tag of the published
image, but by default the following images are used.

- **`op-reth`**: ghcr.io/paradigmxyz/op-reth:latest
- **`kona-node`**: ghcr.io/op-rs/kona/kona-node:latest

Before looking at the individual `kona-node` service, there are a few
key things shared between `op-reth` and `kona-node` worth noting.
