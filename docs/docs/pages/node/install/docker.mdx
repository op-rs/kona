# Docker

There are two ways to obtain a Kona Docker image:

1. [GitHub](#github)
2. [Building it from source](#building-the-docker-image)

Once you have obtained the Docker image, you can run the node.

Jump ahead to [Run a Node using Docker page](/node/run/docker).


## GitHub

Kona docker images are published with every release of reth on GitHub Container Registry.

You can obtain the latest image with:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/op-rs/kona
```

<Callout type="note">
Specify a specific version (e.g. v0.1.0) like so.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/op-rs/kona:v0.1.0
```
</Callout>

You can test the image with:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/op-rs/kona --version
```

If you can see the [latest release](https://github.com/op-rs/kona/releases) version,
then you've successfully installed Kona via Docker.


## Building the Docker image

To build the image from source, navigate to the root of the repository and run:

```bash
just build-local kona-node
```

<Callout type="note">
This will create an image with the tag `kona:local`. To specify a custom
tag, just pass it in after `kona-node` in the command above, like so:

```bash
just build-local kona-node my-custom-tag
```
</Callout>

The build will likely take several minutes. Once it's built, test it with:

```bash
docker run kona:local --version
```
