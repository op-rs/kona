# Building from Source

:::note

Building from source requires that the Rust toolchain is installed, as well as the `just` command runner.

Visit the [Prerequisites](/node/install/overview) for details on installing Rust and `just`.

:::

First clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/op-rs/kona.git
cd kona
```

Then, install the `kona-node` binary into your PATH directly via:

```bash
cargo install --locked --path bin/node --bin kona-node
```

The binary will now be accessible as `kona-node` via the command line,
and exist under your default .cargo/bin folder.

Alternatively, you can build yourself with:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin kona-node
```

This will place the reth binary under `./target/release/kona-node`, and
you can copy it to your directory of preference after that.

## Update Kona

You can update the `kona-node` to a specific version by running the
commands below.

`${VERSION}` is the version you wish to build in the format `vX.X.X`.

```bash
git fetch
git checkout ${VERSION}
cargo build --release --bin kona-node
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command is not found

Reth will be installed to `CARGO_HOME` or `$HOME/.cargo`.
This directory needs to be on your `PATH` before you can run the
`kona-node` binary.

See ["Configuring the PATH environment variable"][path] for more information.

[path]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### Compilation error

Make sure you are running the latest version of Rust.
If you have installed Rust using rustup, simply run `rustup update`.

If you can't install the latest version of Rust you can instead compile
using the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) which is listed under
the `rust-version` key in kona's [Cargo.toml](https://github.com/op-rs/kona/blob/main/Cargo.toml).

If compilation fails with `(signal: 9, SIGKILL: kill)`, this could mean
your machine ran out of memory during compilation. If you are on Docker,
consider increasing the memory of the container, or use a [pre-built
binary](/node/install/binaries).

If compilation fails with `error: linking with cc failed: exit code: 1`,
try running `cargo clean`.
