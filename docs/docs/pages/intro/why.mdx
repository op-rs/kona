# Why Kona?

Kona leverages the abstractions of the Rust Ethereum ecosystem
providing a modular, extensible implementation of the OP Stack.
By re-implementing the OP Stack in Rust, Kona brings the
superchain into a robust, multi-client future.

## Abstractions

Building off learnings from the [optimism monorepo][optimism], Kona
is trait abstracted and customizable. Entire components can be swapped
out, and new behavior easily injected.

- **Components**: Kona is built and grouped into modular components
   that can be used independently or together. This allows developers to
   pick and choose the parts they need for their specific use case.
- **Trait Abstractions**: Kona uses trait abstractions between and inside
   components to allow for easy customization and extension.
- **Public Crates**: Using Rust's crate system, Kona benefits from upstream
   improvements through crate re-use. It also means, custom components for
   Kona can be easily shared and reused across the ecosystem.


## Adoption

Kona is being adopted and customized through its [abstractions](#abstractions)
across the OP Stack ecosystem. Further, Kona's OP Stack components are
continuously being tested against the reference implementations in the
[Optimism Monorepo][optimism] to ensure compatibility and correctness
(in both implementations). Continuous testing happens across different
repository CI sets as well as long-lived testnets and periphery nodes.


## Community

Contributions are highly praised and appreciated. It's extremely difficult
to build a thriving contributor community. Kona isn't where we'd like to be
just yet, but we aspire to be like Reth.

That said, come join us and leave a lasting impact on the OP Stack!
