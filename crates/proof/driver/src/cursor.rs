/// # Cache Management
/// The cursor maintains a cache of recent L1/L2 mappings with a capacity based on the
/// channel timeout. This ensures that reorgs within the channel timeout can be handled

/// When L1 reorgs occur, the cursor can reset to a previous safe state within the
/// channel timeout window, allowing derivation to continue from a known good state
/// rather than starting over.

/// usage while providing sufficient history for reorg recovery.
