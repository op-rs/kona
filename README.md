## What's Kona?

Originally a suite of portable implementations of the OP Stack rollup state transition,
Kona has been extended to be _the monorepo_ for <a href="https://specs.optimism.io/">OP Stack</a>
types, components, and services built in Rust. Kona provides an ecosystem of extensible, low-level
crates that compose into components and services required for the OP Stack.

The [book][book] contains a more in-depth overview of the project, contributor guidelines, tutorials for
getting started with building your own programs, and a reference for the libraries and tools provided by Kona.

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
>
> Ethereum (Alloy) types modified for the OP Stack live in [op-alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/op-alloy).

**Binaries**

- [`client`](./bin/client): The bare-metal program that executes the state transition, to be ran on a prover.
- [`host`](./bin/host): The host program that runs natively alongside the prover, serving as the [Preimage Oracle][g-preimage-oracle] server.
- [`node`](./bin/node): [WIP] A [Rollup Node][rollup-node-spec] implementation, backed by [`kona-derive`](./crates/protocol/derive).

**Protocol**

- [`genesis`](./crates/protocol/genesis): Genesis types for OP Stack chains.
- [`protocol`](./crates/protocol/protocol): Core protocol types used across OP Stack rust crates.
- [`derive`](./crates/protocol/derive): `no_std` compatible implementation of the [derivation pipeline][g-derivation-pipeline].
- [`driver`](./crates/protocol/driver): Stateful derivation pipeline driver.
- [`interop`](./crates/protocol/interop): Core functionality and primitives for the [Interop feature](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/overview.html) of the OP Stack.
- [`registry`](./crates/protocol/registry): Rust bindings for the [superchain-registry][superchain-registry].

**Proof**

- [`mpt`](./crates/proof/mpt): Utilities for interacting with the Merkle Patricia Trie in the client program.
- [`executor`](./crates/proof/executor): `no_std` stateless block executor for the [OP Stack][op-stack].
- [`proof`](./crates/proof/proof): High level OP Stack state transition proof SDK.
- [`proof-interop`](./crates/proof/proof-interop): Extension of `kona-proof` with interop support.
- [`preimage`](./crates/proof/preimage): High level interfaces to the [`PreimageOracle`][fpp-specs] ABI.
- [`std-fpvm`](./crates/proof/std-fpvm): Platform specific [Fault Proof VM][g-fault-proof-vm] kernel APIs.
- [`std-fpvm-proc`](./crates/proof/std-fpvm-proc): Proc macro for [Fault Proof Program][fpp-specs] entrypoints.

**Node**

- [`engine`](./crates/node/engine): An extensible implementation of the [OP Stack][op-stack] rollup node engine client
- [`rpc`](./crates/node/rpc): OP Stack RPC types and extensions.
- [`p2p`](./crates/node/p2p): OP Stack P2P Networking including Gossip and Discovery.
- [`service`](./crates/node/service): The OP Stack rollup node service.

**Providers**

- [`providers-alloy`](./crates/providers/providers-alloy): Provider implementations for `kona-derive` backed by [Alloy][alloy].
- [`providers-local`](./crates/providers/providers-local): Local provider implementations for `kona-derive`.

**Utilities**

- [`serde`](./crates/utilities/serde): Serialization helpers.
- [`cli`](./crates/utilities/cli): Standard CLI utilities, used across `kona`'s binaries.

### Proof

Built on top of these libraries, this repository also features a [proof program][fpp-specs]
designed to deterministically execute the rollup state transition in order to verify an
[L2 output root][g-output-root] from the L1 inputs it was [derived from][g-derivation-pipeline].

Kona's libraries were built with alternative backend support and extensibility in mind - the repository features
a fault proof virtual machine backend for use in the governance-approved OP Stack, but it's portable across
provers! Kona is also used by:

- [`op-succinct`][op-succinct]
- [`kailua`][kailua]

To build your own backend for kona, or build a new application on top of its libraries,
see the [SDK section of the book](https://op-rs.github.io/kona/sdk/intro.html).

## MSRV

The current MSRV (minimum supported rust version) is `1.85`.

The MSRV is not increased automatically, and will be updated
only as part of a patch (pre-1.0) or minor (post-1.0) release.


## Crate Releases

`kona` releases are done using the [`cargo-release`](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-release) crate.
A detailed guide is available in [./RELEASES.md](./RELEASES.md).


## Contributing

`kona` is built by open source contributors like you, thank you for improving the project!

A [contributing guide][contributing] is available that sets guidelines for contributing.

Pull requests will not be merged unless CI passes, so please ensure that your contribution
follows the linting rules and passes clippy.


## Credits

`kona` is inspired by the work of several teams, namely [OP Labs][op-labs] and other contributors' work on the
[Optimism monorepo][op-go-monorepo] and [BadBoiLabs][bad-boi-labs]'s work on [Cannon-rs][badboi-cannon-rs].

`kona` is also built on rust types in [alloy][alloy], [op-alloy][op-alloy], and [maili][maili].
