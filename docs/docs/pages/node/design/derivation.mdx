# Derivation in Kona Node

The derivation system in kona-node is responsible for transforming L1 data into L2 payload attributes that can be executed to produce the canonical L2 blocks. This document covers how the [`kona-derive`][kd] crate is integrated and used within the kona-node architecture.

## Overview

The derivation subsystem in kona-node is built around the **DerivationActor**, which manages the derivation pipeline lifecycle and coordinates with other node components. The actor uses the trait-abstracted [`kona-derive`][kd] pipeline to continuously process L1 data and produce L2 payload attributes.

### Key Components

- **DerivationActor**: The main actor responsible for running the derivation pipeline
- **OnlinePipeline**: A concrete implementation of the derivation pipeline using online providers
- **PipelineBuilder**: Trait for constructing derivation pipelines with different configurations
- **DerivationState**: Manages pipeline state and stepping logic
- **Signal System**: Handles pipeline resets, hardfork activations, and error conditions

## Architecture

### DerivationActor

The `DerivationActor` is a [`NodeActor`][na] that runs as part of the node service. It receives messages from other actors and steps the derivation pipeline forward to produce new payload attributes.

```rust
pub struct DerivationActor<B>
where
    B: PipelineBuilder,
{
    /// The state for the derivation actor.
    state: B,
    /// Receiver for L1 head update notifications.
    l1_head_updates: watch::Receiver<Option<BlockInfo>>,
    /// Receiver for L2 safe head update notifications.
    engine_l2_safe_head: watch::Receiver<L2BlockInfo>,
    /// Receiver for engine sync completion signal.
    el_sync_complete_rx: oneshot::Receiver<()>,
    /// Receiver for pipeline signals.
    derivation_signal_rx: mpsc::Receiver<Signal>,
}
```

The actor coordinates with several other node components:
- **Engine Actor**: Receives payload attributes for execution and sends safe head updates
- **P2P Actors**: Receives L1 head updates from the network
- **RPC Actors**: May trigger pipeline resets or provide status information

### Pipeline Construction

The derivation pipeline is constructed using the `DerivationBuilder` which implements the `PipelineBuilder` trait:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct DerivationBuilder {
    /// The L1 provider.
    pub l1_provider: RootProvider,
    /// The L1 beacon client.
    pub l1_beacon: OnlineBeaconClient,
    /// The L2 provider.
    pub l2_provider: RootProvider<Optimism>,
    /// The rollup config.
    pub rollup_config: Arc<RollupConfig>,
    /// The interop mode.
    pub interop_mode: InteropMode,
}
```

The builder creates an `OnlinePipeline` which can operate in two modes:

1. **Polled Mode**: Uses `PollingTraversal` for L1 block traversal
2. **Indexed Mode**: Uses `IndexedTraversal` for more efficient L1 block handling

```rust
let pipeline = match self.interop_mode {
    InteropMode::Polled => OnlinePipeline::new_polled(
        self.rollup_config.clone(),
        OnlineBlobProvider::init(self.l1_beacon.clone()).await,
        l1_derivation_provider,
        l2_derivation_provider,
    ),
    InteropMode::Indexed => OnlinePipeline::new_indexed(
        self.rollup_config.clone(),
        OnlineBlobProvider::init(self.l1_beacon.clone()).await,
        l1_derivation_provider,
        l2_derivation_provider,
    ),
};
```

### Provider Configuration

The node uses caching providers to optimize performance:

- **AlloyChainProvider**: Provides L1 blockchain data with configurable cache size
- **AlloyL2ChainProvider**: Provides L2 blockchain data and system configuration
- **OnlineBlobProvider**: Retrieves blob data from the beacon chain for post-4844 transactions

The cache size is set to 1024 entries by default:

```rust
const DERIVATION_PROVIDER_CACHE_SIZE: usize = 1024;
```

## Pipeline Operation

### Main Processing Loop

The derivation actor runs a continuous loop that handles various events:

1. **Shutdown signals**: Graceful shutdown when cancellation token is triggered
2. **L1 head updates**: Triggers derivation when new L1 blocks are available  
3. **Safe head updates**: Triggers derivation when the L2 safe head advances
4. **Pipeline signals**: Handles resets, hardfork activations, and channel flushes

### Stepping Logic

The core derivation logic is implemented in `produce_next_attributes()`:

```rust
async fn produce_next_attributes(
    &mut self,
    engine_l2_safe_head: &watch::Receiver<L2BlockInfo>,
    reset_request_tx: &mpsc::Sender<()>,
) -> Result<OpAttributesWithParent, DerivationError>
```

This method continuously steps the pipeline until payload attributes are produced:

1. **Step the pipeline** with the current L2 safe head
2. **Handle step results**:
   - `PreparedAttributes`: Attributes are ready to be consumed
   - `AdvancedOrigin`: Pipeline advanced to next L1 block
   - `OriginAdvanceErr`/`StepFailed`: Handle various error conditions
3. **Return attributes** when available

### Error Handling

The derivation actor handles three categories of pipeline errors:

#### Temporary Errors
- `PipelineError::NotEnoughData`: Continue stepping, more data may become available
- `PipelineError::Eof`: Yield and wait for more L1 data

#### Reset Errors  
- `ResetError::HoloceneActivation`: Send `ActivationSignal` to handle hardfork
- `ResetError::ReorgDetected`: Send reset request to engine (if not in interop mode)
- Other reset errors: Wait for external signal before continuing

#### Critical Errors
- Unrecoverable errors that terminate the derivation process
- Increment metrics counter and propagate error up

### Signal Handling

The pipeline supports several signal types for coordination:

- **ResetSignal**: Resets pipeline state with new L1 origin and system config
- **ActivationSignal**: Handles hardfork activations (e.g., Holocene)
- **FlushChannel**: Invalidates current channel data for deposit-only blocks

Signals are sent from the engine actor when specific conditions are detected during payload execution.

## Configuration

### Rollup Configuration

The derivation pipeline requires a [`RollupConfig`][rc] that defines:
- Chain parameters (chain ID, block time, etc.)
- Hardfork activation heights
- System configuration addresses
- Batch and channel parameters

### Runtime Configuration

Runtime configuration includes:
- Provider cache sizes
- Polling intervals for L1 data
- Interop mode selection
- Metrics collection settings

## Integration Patterns

### With Engine Actor

The derivation actor produces `OpAttributesWithParent` that are sent to the engine actor for execution:

```rust
// Send payload attributes for execution
derived_attributes_tx
    .send(payload_attrs)
    .await
    .map_err(|e| DerivationError::Sender(Box::new(e)))?;
```

The engine actor executes these attributes and updates the L2 safe head, which triggers the next derivation cycle.

### With P2P Layer

The derivation actor receives L1 head updates from the P2P layer, which indicate when new L1 data is available for processing:

```rust
Some(msg) = self.l1_head_updates.changed() => {
    if let Err(e) = state.process(
        InboundDerivationMessage::L1HeadUpdated,
        // ... other parameters
    ).await {
        // Handle derivation error
    }
}
```

### With RPC Layer

The RPC layer can query derivation status and potentially trigger pipeline operations through the standard node RPC interface.

## Metrics and Observability

The derivation actor exposes several metrics for monitoring:

- `DERIVATION_L1_ORIGIN`: Current L1 origin block number
- `DERIVATION_CRITICAL_ERROR`: Count of critical derivation errors  
- `L1_REORG_COUNT`: Count of detected L1 reorganizations

These metrics help operators monitor the health and progress of the derivation process.
