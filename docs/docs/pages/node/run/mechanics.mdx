# How it Works

Kona brings together a powerful suite of `no-std` and `std` Rust components,
purpose-built for the OP Stack. At the heart of this ecosystem is the
`kona-node` — a modern, modular rollup node (L2 consensus node) that can
be used as a drop-in binary or as a foundation for custom services.

The `kona-node` is a fully compliant implementation of the ["Rollup Node"
Specifications][rollup-node] and is released as a [binary][package] in
the [kona repository][kona]. Whether you're running a production network,
building new rollup features, or experimenting with the OP Stack,
`kona-node` is built to be both robust and extensible.


### Background

A rollup node is responsible for deriving the canonical L2 chain from L1
blocks and their receipts. It validates these blocks using the
[Engine API][engine-api], passing them to the execution layer for processing.

Paired with an execution engine like op-reth or op-geth, `kona-node` tracks
the unsafe, safe, and finalized tips of the L2 OP Stack chain, ensuring the
node is always in sync with the latest state.

:::note

Rollup nodes hold minimal state. Unsafe and safe payloads alike are sent
away to the execution engine client which holds the chain's db. This way,
the rollup node holds a view of the tip of the chain - unsafe, safe, and
finalized block info. All data otherwise needed is held in memory.

:::

There are a few core architectural pieces of the `kona-node`.

- **Derivation Pipeline:** Constructs L2 payload attributes from L1 blocks,
  forming the backbone of rollup logic.
- **Execution Engine Integration:** Executes L2 payload attributes via the
  [Engine API][engine-api], abstracting away different EL clients.
- **P2P Networking:** Enables block gossip and peer discovery.

For an in-depth breakdown of these three pillars and a detailed design
of the `kona-node`, visit the [Node Design section](/node/design/intro).

Additionally, an RPC server exposes essential methods, including the
[L2 Output RPC method][l2o-rpc].


### Syncing

The `kona-node` syncs the L2 chain in two main phases:

1. **Execution Layer (EL) Sync:**
   When starting, the node initially has an empty engine task queue.
   Once an unsafe block is received from P2P gossip, an `InsertUnsafe`
   task is executed. The `InsertUnsafe` task executes a forkchoice
   update through the engine api. Since the engine state is lazily
   initialized (the safe and finalized heads are zero), the forkchoice
   update kicks off EL sync on the execution layer (EL) client (such
   as op-reth or op-geth). EL sync instructs the execution client to
   fetch and sync L2 blocks directly from peers. During this phase,
   the `kona-node` effectively waits for the EL client to reach the
   chain tip, when it returns that it is `synced`. No L2 blocks
   are derived from L1 during this period.

2. **Consensus Layer (CL) Sync:**
   Once the EL client is fully synced to the tip, the node transitions
   to consensus layer (CL) sync. In this phase, `kona-node` begins
   deriving new L2 payload attributes from the L1 chain, following
   the rollup derivation process. `OpPayloadAttributesWithParent`
   derived this way are executed as an engine task which submits
   the payloads to the execution engine for validation and execution.

:::note

- `kona-node` does **not** support historical CL sync or backfilling
  L2 blocks from L1 for past chain history. It relies on the EL client
  to perform the initial sync of the L2 chain.
- Only after the EL is fully synced does the node begin deriving and
  following new L2 blocks from L1.

### Extensibility

The `kona-node` is designed as a modular, actor-based node SDK,
making it possible to extend or customize node behavior by adding
new actors or swapping out existing ones. This extensibility is
currently in **beta**, but the architecture is intentionally built
to support advanced use cases and custom integrations.


#### Actor Model

At the core of `kona-node` is the concept of **actors**—independent,
async services that communicate via channels. Each actor implements
the `NodeActor` trait, which defines how the actor is built, started,
and how it communicates with other actors.

Key built-in actors include:
- **EngineActor**: Manages the execution layer (EL) Engine API.
- **DerivationActor**: Runs the derivation pipeline to produce L2 payloads.
- **NetworkActor**: Handles P2P networking and block gossip.
- **RpcActor**: Runs the node's RPC server.
- **SupervisorActor**: Integrates with the supervisor RPC API.
- **L1WatcherRpc**: Watches L1 for new blocks and events.


#### Extending with Custom Actors

You can add your own actors to the node by implementing the `NodeActor`
trait. This allows you to introduce new background services, event
processors, or integrations with external systems.

**Example: Defining a Custom Actor**

```rust
use kona_node_service::NodeActor;
use async_trait::async_trait;
use tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken;

struct MyCustomActor;

#[async_trait]
impl NodeActor for MyCustomActor {
    type Error = std::io::Error;
    type InboundData = MyCustomContext;
    type OutboundData = ();
    type State = ();

    fn build(_state: Self::State) -> (Self::OutboundData, Self) {
        ((), MyCustomActor)
    }

    async fn start(self, ctx: Self::InboundData) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        // Your actor logic here
        Ok(())
    }
}

struct MyCustomContext {
    cancellation: CancellationToken,
}

impl kona_node_service::CancellableContext for MyCustomContext {
    fn cancelled(&self) -> tokio_util::sync::WaitForCancellationFuture<'_> {
        self.cancellation.cancelled()
    }
}
```

#### Integrating Custom Actors

To integrate your custom actor, you can create your own implementation
of the `RollupNodeService` trait, which defines the set of actors and
pipelines used by the node. You can swap out any of the built-in actors
for your own, or add entirely new ones.

**Example: Custom RollupNodeService**

```rust
use kona_node_service::{RollupNodeService, NodeActor, ...};

struct MyNodeService;

#[async_trait]
impl RollupNodeService for MyNodeService {
    // Use built-in actors, or your own custom ones
    type DataAvailabilityWatcher = MyCustomActor;
    type DerivationPipeline = ...;
    type DerivationActor = ...;
    type EngineActor = ...;
    type NetworkActor = ...;
    type SupervisorExt = ...;
    type SupervisorActor = ...;
    type RpcActor = ...;
    type Error = ...;

    // Implement required trait methods...
}
```

You can then instantiate and run your custom node service in your
own binary or integration test.

#### Programmatic Node Construction

The `RollupNodeBuilder` provides a convenient way to construct a
standard node, but for advanced use cases, you can build your own
node by composing actors and services directly, or by implementing
your own builder pattern.

#### Current Limitations

- The extensibility API is **beta** and may change.
- Most users will want to start by subclassing or wrapping the
  standard `RollupNode` and only override specific actors or
  pipelines as needed.
- Documentation and examples for advanced extensibility are still
  evolving—contributions and feedback are welcome!
