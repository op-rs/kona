description: Installation instructions for Kona.
---

## Prerequisites

Before installing Kona, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Rust toolchain** (MSRV: 1.82)
- **`just`** command runner
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized builds)

### Installing Rust

If you don't have Rust installed, you can install it using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Rustup is an easy way to update the Rust compiler, and works on all platforms.

:::tip

-   During installation, when prompted, enter `1` for the default installation.
-   After Rust installation completes, try running `cargo version` . If it cannot
    be found, run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`. After that, running `cargo version` should return the version, for example `cargo 1.68.2`.
-   It's generally advisable to append `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to `~/.bashrc`.

:::

The Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is 1.82.0. If you
already have a version of Rust installed, you can check your version by running
`rustc --version`. To update your version of Rust, run rustup update.


### Installing Just

`just` is a command runner that Kona uses for build tasks. Install it with:

```bash
cargo install just
```

## Installation Methods

There are three ways to obtain Kona:

-   [Docker images](/node/install/docker)
-   [Pre-built binaries](/node/install/binaries)
-   [Building from source](/node/install/source)

:::note
If you have Docker installed, we recommend using the [Docker recipe](/node/run/docker) configuration
that will have kona-node, op-reth, Prometheus and Grafana running and syncing with just one command.
