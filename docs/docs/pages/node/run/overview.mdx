# Run a Node

Now that you have [installed the `kona-node`](/node/install/overview),
it's time to run it.

In this section, we'll guide you through running the kona-node on
various networks and with different configurations.


## Supported Networks

Kona uses the [superchain-registry][scr] to dynamically load
chain configurations for the specified network. As such, Kona
can only support networks that are defined this way.

[scr]: https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry

To view available networks, the `kona-node` binary provides
a `registry` subcommand that lists all available networks:

```bash
kona-node registry
```

Want to add support for a new network?
Feel free to [add a chain](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/docs/ops.md#adding-a-chain)
to the superchain-registry!
