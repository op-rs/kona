# Node Design Overview

The entry-point for the `kona-node` is the [`RollupNodeService`][trait]
trait which encapsulates the core wiring for the node. The default
implementation of the trait [`start` method][start] handles connecting
all the different components of the node, running each in a spawned
thread. As such, each node component is considered an actor.

The [`RollupNodeService`][trait] abstracts individual actors through
the [`NodeActor` trait][actor]. With the `NodeActor` trait, the
`RollupNodeService` builds the actor and then starts it.

Kona provides implementations for all `NodeActor`s required
to run a `RollupNodeService`. Actors are defined in the
[actors][actors] module of the `kona-node-service` crate.

The `kona-node` is an implementation of the `RollupNodeService`
that lives in the [standard][standard] module.


### Actors

The architecture of `kona-node` is a web of actors that share
state through message passing, using channels, rather than using
shared memory.

The [`RollupNodeService`][trait] defines the set of required
actors using associated types. These are subject to change,
but are currently defined as follows.

- **Derivation Actor**: Orchestrates the derivation pipeline,
  deriving L2 payload attributes from l1 blocks. Payload
  attributes prepared this way are forwarded to the Engine
  Actor to be executed. The [derivation][derivation] docs
  dive deeper into how the derivation actor works.
- **Engine Actor**: Brokers the connection to the execution
  layer client (or "execution engine"). The engine actor
  turns messages from other actors into engine "tasks"
  that are executed in a round-robin against the EL client.
  The [engine][engine] docs expand on this.
- **Network Actor**: Manages the P2P Network for the rollup
  node. The P2P stack consists of `discv5` peer discovery
  and block gossip through libp2p. Visit the [network][p2p]
  docs for more detail.
- **Supervisor Actor (beta)**: The supervisor actor is an
  interop feature that allows the `kona-node` to be
  "managed" (or "indexed") by the supervisor - a new
  component in the OP Stack. A detailed overview of
  interop and the supervisor's role is provided in the
  [supervisor][supervisor] docs.
- **Runtime Actor**: Loads runtime values from the contracts
  on the L1 chain for the OP Stack. This is a very
  light-weight actor described in [runtime][runtime] docs.
- **Sequencer Actor**: The sequencer actor extends the
  `kona-node` to be run as a sequencer. Sequencing is
  periphery to the basic rollup node operation. See
  the [sequencer][sequencer].
- **RPC Actor**: The RPC actor spins up and serves an
  RPC server that exposes the rpc methods required by
  the [OP Stack Specs][specs].
