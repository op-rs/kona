/// guarantees for the L2 execution layer and other actors. A priority queue, ordered by
/// [`EngineTask`]'s [`Ord`] implementation, is used to prioritize tasks executed by the
/// [`Engine::drain`] method.

/// [`EngineState`], and are given exclusive access to the engine state during execution.
///
/// Tasks within the queue are also considered fallible. If they fail with a temporary error,
/// they are not popped from the queue, the error is returned, and they are retried on the
/// next call to [`Engine::drain`].
