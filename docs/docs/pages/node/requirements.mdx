# System Requirements

`kona-node` is an L2 consensus client, so it stores almost nothing on disk!

<Callout type="note">
Anything stored on disk is configurable, and can be disabled.
</Callout>

As a rollup node, it always sends L2 blocks over to the execution client
(`op-reth` or `op-geth`) for execution. That way, chain state is entirely
handled by the execution client. In this way, the `kona-node` is incredibly
lightweight and can be run on a wide range of hardware.

That said, a stable and dependable internet connection is critical for the
peer-to-peer (P2P) part of the node. The `kona-node` relies on P2P communication
to sync the unsafe chain. If the connection is unstable, the node may
struggle to keep up, and could be banned by its peers for being too slow.
