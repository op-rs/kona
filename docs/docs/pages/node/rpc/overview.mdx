# JSON-RPC

The `kona-node` supports JSON-RPC for interacting with the node.

Currently, `kona-node` only supports the HTTP transport.

Websocket and IPC transports are not yet implemented.

### Namespaces

JSON-RPC methods are grouped into namespaces, which are listed below:

| Namespace                    | Description                                                                                            | Sensitive |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| [`p2p`](/jsonrpc/p2p)        | The `p2p` API allows you to configure the p2p stack.                                                   | Maybe     |
| [`rollup`](/jsonrpc/rollup)  | The `rollup` API provides OP Stack specific rpc methods.                                               | No        |
| [`admin`](/jsonrpc/admin)    | The `admin` API allows you to configure your node.                                                     | **Yes**   |


### Interacting with the RPC

Kona enables these RPC methods by default.

You can interact with the RPC using any JSON-RPC client, such as `curl`, `httpie`, or a custom client in your preferred programming language.
