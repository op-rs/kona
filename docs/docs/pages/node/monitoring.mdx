# Monitoring

The `kona-node` exposes metrics by default. Optionally, metrics
can be disabled with the `--metrics.disabled` cli flag.

Unless otherwise specified, metrics are exposed on port `9090`.

To grab a snapshot of the metrics, you can visit `0.0.0.0:9090`
or `curl` the url.

```
curl 0.0.0.0:9090
```

The output should be raw text mapping metrics with their values.

Remember, this is just a snapshot of the metrics at that point
in time. To record and visualize the metrics, we'll use
[Grafana and Prometheus](#-Grafana-and-Prometheus).


## Grafana and Prometheus

Prometheus is a simple service that scrapes metrics at a predefined
interval. Grafana then uses Prometheus as a "Data Source" to
visualize the collected metrics.

The Reth book provides a great overview to setting up [Prometheus
and Grafana][setup]. Visit the Reth docs to follow along.

The `kona-node` comes shipped with a default Grafana dashboard
for the `kona-node`. To import the dashboard to grafana, click
the `+` icon > `Import Dashboard` > paste the contents of [kona's
dashboard][dashboard] in the textbox > `Load`.
